1. Recall that N is the size of the data set and d is the dimensionality of the input space. 
The primal formulation of the linear soft-margin support vector machine problem, without going through the Lagrangian dual problem, is

A:a quadratic programming problem with N+d+1 variables

2. What is the equation of the optimal separating hyperplane in the Z space?

A:z1=4.5


3. Consider the same training data set as Question 2, but instead of explicitly transforming the input space X to 
Z, apply the hard-margin support vector machine algorithm with the kernel function 

A:2.8


4. Following Question 3, what is the corresponding nonlinear curve in the X space?
A. 1/9*(8x1^2−16x1+6x2^2−15)=0

5. Compare the two nonlinear curves found in Questions 2 and 4, which of the following is true?
A. 
The curves should be different in the X space, because they are learned with respect to different Z spaces
